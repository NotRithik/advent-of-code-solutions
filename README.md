# Advent of Code

Hey! We're just a bunch of friends taking up the [Advent of Code challenge](https://adventofcode.com)!

Look around if you wish to see what solutions we came up with :p

***
## Instructions to **submit a pull request**:
**Step 1:** Fork the directory, and clone it on your PC.

**Step 2:** For your solution for a particular challenge, name your file as **\<*Your GitHub Username*\>_<*Problem Number*>.\<*Your chosen language\'s file extension*\>**.

For example, I'd name it as **NotRithik_1.cpp** if I coded my solution for a particular day's first problem, in C++.

**Step 3:** Place the file in the corresponding day's directory.

For example, I'd place it in **2021/Day 01**, if I solved the first day's problem.

**Step 4:** Submit pull request!
